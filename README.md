## What This Skill Enables

This skill gives AI agents real-time access to your personal context captured by Bee, enabling deeply personalized assistance based on what's happening right now and your life history.

### Real-Time Context

Your agent knows what's happening now:
- **Live access** to conversations from the last 10 hours with full utterance transcripts
- **Immediate awareness** of who you're talking to and what you're discussing
- **Current context** to provide relevant assistance in the moment

Ask things like:
- "What was I just talking about?"
- "Summarize my meeting that just ended"
- "What did they say about the deadline?"
- "Help me follow up on what Sarah mentioned"

### Life Overview

Your agent understands who you are:
- **Personal facts** — your preferences, relationships, work, interests
- **Conversation history** — searchable archive of past discussions
- **Voice memos** — your captured thoughts and ideas
- **Relationships** — who the people in your life are and your history with them

Ask things like:
- "Who is John and how do I know him?"
- "What do I know about the company I'm meeting with tomorrow?"
- "What have I been working on this week?"
- "When did I last talk to my mom?"
- "What restaurant did Mike recommend last month?"

## Privacy & Security

All Bee data is end-to-end encrypted and accessible only to you. The agent accesses your data through authenticated API calls — your conversations remain private and secure.

## Requirements

- [Bee CLI](https://github.com/bee-computer/bee-cli/releases/latest) installed
- Bee account with authenticated session
